# Info about linking up with Github afterwards

If you need to connect this local repository to a remote repository (like one on GitHub), you would add the remote repository URL with:

```
git remote add origin your-remote-repository-URL
```

And then you can push your commits to the remote repository with:

```
git push -u origin master
```

Remember to replace your-remote-repository-URL with the actual URL to your remote repository.
